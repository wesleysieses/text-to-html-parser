# Text to HTML Parser

A very light widget which parses text from the database to HTML. Total widget size is only 6KB.

1. Clone or fetch this repo
2. `npm i` inside the local repo
3. Optionally put the path to your Mendix app inside userConfig.conf so your widget gets copied & deployed automatically.
4. `gulp` to watch changes or `gulp build` to create widget file.
